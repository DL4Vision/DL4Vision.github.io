## ImageNet Based Models

ImageNet is an image dataset originally created to classify an image. Initially there were 14 million images classified into 20000 categories by humans. Recently the popularity of object detection, 1 million images have been annotated with bounding boxes. 

The purpose of the repo is to provide quick link to the desired model ***pretrained on the ImageNet dataset for image classification***.

Table 1 lists the models found in [Keras](https://keras.io/api/applications/), [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html) and [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.5.0/tutorials/gluon/pretrained_models.html)
